The purpose of our ecosystem is to establish a network of states that connects a farmer to an organization and enterprise consisting of Agriculture Enterprise, Food and Nutrition Service, Fitness Center, and Vendor Enterprise. We have designed an ecosystem where we manage Produce Distribution, Approval Status, Order Status for the clients for their required produces, Lab Testing for the clients to detect the defeciencies, and suggest proper diet plan for clients to recover through their deficiencies. We have 4 Enterprises, 6 Organizations, and 8 Roles. This demonstrates the robustness of our Ecosystem. We aim to provide an easy and user friendly workflow for a client to recover through his defeciency by consuming the required produces mentioned in his/her diet plan. Following are the features of our application. 

 - Fitness Center can identify client and their medical history
 - Dietitian can acknowledge the issues faced by client and will suggest
   a test which will be performed at a Pathologist
 - Ability for countys to provide produces to the client which are produced by farmer
 - Ability for suggesting a diet plan to the client to overcome their defeciencies 
 - Ability for a Farmer to produce the yeild and send it to the Food and Nutrition Service for getting it approved and further store it in county
